Power systems must constantly maintain a balance between the instantaneous supply and demand for electricity. Coming technologies such as energy storage and demand-side management (dened below) promise to make a significant contribution to this balancing challenge. A highly topical example is Tesla's recently announced Powerwall [^fn1], a rechargeable lithium-ion battery product for home use which stores electricity for domestic consumption, load shifting, and backup power. The proposed research will explore the dynamic, multiplayer, economic and operational "games" arising when energy storage and demand-side management technologies are applied to power system balancing. The operators of these technologies, as well as the entity responsible for balancing, are treated as agents within one or more markets for electricity.

By studying dynamic games we will address two fundamental research questions: firstly, how the operators of such new technologies should optimally act, and secondly how they should be appropriately rewarded in order to produce a suitable dynamic equilibrium in the balancing service they can provide. Further, by appropriately extending these games to networks we will explore how the dynamic equilibria change when such technologies are aggregated through third parties.

In the most ambitious part of this proposal we will explore the effect of multiplex and evolving network topology when, for example, participation in load balancing is in uenced by the participation of peers.
