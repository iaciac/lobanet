Upside Energy has successfully secured funding from Innovate UK to pilot a virtual energy store aggregating thousands of domestic storage and response devices in a consortium project involving Sharp Laboratories of Europe Ltd, and also a DECC Energy Entrepreneurs award to create an open innovation environment to develop algorithms for portfolio optimisation within their energy store. Upside Energy's business model is focused on energy storage rather than demand response and their business concept is at the center of our proposed network modelling.
