  bio: I am Professor of Applied Mathematics, Chair of Complex Systems, and Head of the Complex Systems and Networks Research Group in the School of Mathematical Sciences of QMUL. I am editor of the newly launched Journal of Complex Networks. I study the structure and the dynamics of complex systems, using my background as theoretical physicist and some of the methods proper to statistical physics and non-linear dynamics, to look into biological problems, to model social systems, and to find new solutions for the design of man-made networks.
