  bio: Vito Latora is a Professor of Applied Mathematics, Chair of Complex Systems, and Head of the <a href='%{http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/complex-systems-and-networks/complex-systems-and-networks-group}'><b>Complex Systems and Networks Research Group</b></a> in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary, University of London. He is Editor of the newly launched <a href='%{http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/comnet/editorial_board.html}'><b>Journal of Complex Networks</b></a>. He studies the structure and the dynamics of complex systems, using his background as theoretical physicist and some methods borrowed from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics, to look into biological problems, to model social systems, and to find new solutions for the design of man-made networks.

- name: Randall Martyr
  role: Researcher
  img: https://iaciac.github.io/nash/img/members/Martyr.jpg
  bio: Randall hails from the sunny tropical island of Saint Lucia in the West Indies and joined QMUL as a postdoctoral research associate in November, 2015 on EPSRC Grant EP/K00557X/2, "Optimal Prediction in Local Electricity Markets". His research is in optimisation problems that involve stochastic (random) processes, for example, stochastic control and stochastic differential games. Randall has a BSc in Mathematics and Information Technology (Double Major) from The University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus; and an MSc and PhD in Financial Mathematics from The University of Manchester.
