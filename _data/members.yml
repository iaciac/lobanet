- name: Randall Martyr
  role: Researcher
  img: https://iaciac.github.io/lobanet/img/members/Martyr.jpg
  bio: Randall hails from the sunny tropical island of Saint Lucia in the West Indies and joined QMUL as a postdoctoral research associate in November, 2015 on EPSRC Grant EP/K00557X/2, "Optimal Prediction in Local Electricity Markets". His research is in optimisation problems that involve stochastic (random) processes, for example, stochastic control and stochastic differential games. Randall has a BSc in Mathematics and Information Technology (Double Major) from The University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus; and an MSc and PhD in Financial Mathematics from The University of Manchester.
