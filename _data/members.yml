  bio: Christian Beck is a Professor of Applied Mathematics in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary, University of London. His research interests are in Nonlinear Dynamics, Stochastic Processes, and Statistical Physics, including mathematical modelling of complex systems and interdisciplinary applications. He is Head of the [Dynamical Systems and Statistical Physics Group](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/dynamical-systems-and-statistical-physics/dynamical-systems-and-statistical-physics-group) at Queen Mary, University of London. I am also Chair of the [Statistical and Nonlinear Physics Division](http://eps.site-ym.com/members/group.aspx?id=85204) of the [European Physical Society (EPS)](http://www.eps.org/).

  bio: Vito Latora is a Professor of Applied Mathematics, Chair of Complex Systems, and Head of the [Complex Systems and Networks Research Group](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/complex-systems-and-networks/complex-systems-and-networks-group) in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary, University of London. He is Editor of the newly launched [Journal of Complex Networks](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/comnet/editorial_board.html). He studies the structure and the dynamics of complex systems, using his background as theoretical physicist and some methods borrowed from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics, to look into biological problems, to model social systems, and to find new solutions for the design of man-made networks.
