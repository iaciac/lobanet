  bio: I am Professor of Applied Mathematics, Chair of Complex Systems, and Head of the Complex Systems and Networks Research Group in the School of Mathematical Sciences of QMUL. I am editor of the newly launched Journal of Complex Networks. I study the structure and the dynamics of complex systems, using my background as theoretical physicist and some of the methods proper to statistical physics and non-linear dynamics, to look into biological problems, to model social systems, and to find new solutions for the design of man-made networks.

  bio: Dr. Kalidindiâ€™s research interests are broadly centered on designing material internal structure (including composition) for optimal performance in any selected application and identifying hybrid processing routes for its manufacture. To this end, he has employed a harmonious blend of experimental, theoretical, and numerical approaches in his research.
