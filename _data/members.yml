  bio: I am a Professor of [Applied Mathematics](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/research/applied) in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/) at [Queen Mary](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/), University of London. My research interests are in Nonlinear Dynamics, Stochastic Processes, and Statistical Physics, including mathematical modelling of complex systems and interdisciplinary applications. I am Head of the [Dynamical Systems and Statistical Physics Group](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/dynamical-systems-and-statistical-physics-group/dynamical-systems-and-statistical-physics-group) at Queen Mary. I am also Chair of the [Statistical and Nonlinear Physics Division](http://eps.site-ym.com/members/group.aspx?id=85204) of the [European Physical Society (EPS)](http://www.eps.org/). I am a Co-Editor of [Europhysics Letters (EPL)](http://www.epletters.net/), an Advisory Editor of [Physica A](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/physica-a-statistical-mechanics-and-its-applications), and an Editor of [Chaos, Solitons, Fractals](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/chaos-solitons-and-fractals).

  bio: David is a PhD student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. David earned a Master’s degree in experimental condensed matter physics at Brigham Young University where he fabricated and characterized thin-films and carbon nanotubes used in nanostructured high capacity battery electrodes and in X-ray windows. As an undergraduate, David studied theoretical physics and researched the evolution of chaotic systems using neural networks at Westminster College. He is a trainee in the NSF IGERT FLAMEL program, and one of the lead developers on PyMKS materials informatics toolkit.

  bio: Dr. Kalidindi’s research interests are broadly centered on designing material internal structure (including composition) for optimal performance in any selected application and identifying hybrid processing routes for its manufacture. To this end, he has employed a harmonious blend of experimental, theoretical, and numerical approaches in his research.
